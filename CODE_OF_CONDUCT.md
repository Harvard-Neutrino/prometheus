# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
2. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
3. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
4. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
5. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
6. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
3. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
4. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
5. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
6. **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
7. Behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community.

### Other Restrictions

1. **Misleading identity.** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
2. **Failing to credit sources.** Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
3. **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
4. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

## Reporting an Issue

When an incident occurs, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, **email [the authors](./README.md#authors) of this software directly using the email addresses listed on Inspire HEP.**

We take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. We will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how best to repair harm. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

### Warning

- **Event**: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.
- **Consequence**: A private, written warning.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair include a private written apology, ackn  owledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.

### Temporary Suspension

- **Event**: A pattern of repeated violations which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings.
- **Consequence**: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions.
- **Repair**: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.
  
### Permanent Ban

- **Event**: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that we determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.
- **Consequence**: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed.
- **Repair**: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit our ability to use our judgment, in keeping with the best interests of our community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
