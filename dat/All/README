ppc-gpu needs the following tables:

cfg.txt	      configuration file with various parameters (DOM efficiency correction is set in this file)

wv.dat	      wavelength-tabulated DOM acceptance calculated from qe_dom2007a table of efficiency.h file
as.dat	      parameters of the angular sensitivity polynomial expansion
	      before running the program create a link to one of the provided files:
	      as.nominal     nominal (measured in the lab)
	      as.holeice     hole ice (corrected by hole ice model)

rnd.txt	      table of random number multipliers for the multiply-with-carry random number generator

tilt.par      files describing the ice tilt
tilt.dat      delete unless using icemodel.sp2 (SPICE^2)

icemodel.par  file with 6 parameters of the icemodel
icemodel.dat  main ice properties table: depth/b_e(400)/a_dust(400)/\delta\tau (as in report icecube/200911002)
	      before running the program create a link to one of the provided files:
	      icemodel.aha   AHA model
	      icemodel.sp1   SPICE model
	      icemodel.sp2   SPICE^2 model
	      icemodel.sp2+  SPICE^2+ model
	      **ATTENTION**
	      You must delete files tilt.par and tilt.dat if using AHA or SPICE, but not SPICE^2
	      Only SPICE^2 and higher have been fitted to use the tilted ice description.
