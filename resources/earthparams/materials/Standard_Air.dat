# crust model file
# PREM + mmc crust setup
# crust data is consistent with MMC mediadef.
#
#   format :
#   MediumType[string] number_of_materials[int]
#   material_pdg[int] weight[double]
#   .....
#
#    - no space before first column
#    - delimiter must be whitespaces
#    - data must include at least 6 materials
#      "INNERCORE", "OUTERCORE", "MANTLE", 
#      "ROCK", "ICE", "AIR", and "VACUUM"
#    - MediumType must be consistent with EarthModelService::MediumType
#    - number_of_materials is the number of atm type in the medium
#    - weight must be normalized to 1 within a MediumType
#    - lines start from '#' or whitespace are treated
#      as comments
