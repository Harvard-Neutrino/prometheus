# crust model file
# PREM (legacy nugen setup)
#
#
#   format :
#   upper_radius[m] density[g/cm^3] label[string]
#    - Data must be in ascending order in upper_radius
#    - no space before first column
#    - delimiter must be whitespaces
#    - data must include at least 5 lines with labels
#      "moho_boundary", "rockice_boundary",
#      "iceair_boundary", "earth_radius", and "atmo_radius"
#    - density must be the density up to the defined radius 
#      except for "moho_boundary"
#    - density of "moho_boundary" should be same as
#      the density of next layer
#    - "earth_radius" is NOT the geophysical boundary.
#      This is the definition that all simulation program
#      regards "the radius of the Earth".
#    - lines start from '#' or whitespace are treated
#      as comments
